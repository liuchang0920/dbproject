            Hello!</p><p>My name is<b> <i>Kate Nash</i>. &lt;3 I am a musician, a songwriter and an artist.</b> I have been independently releasing and touring my own music now for 5 years. And I want to do keep doing that.</p><p>In 2007 I released my 1st album, Made of Bricks and with your help, I would like to release my 4th!</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-id="16087147">

            <p>A few things about me…I’ve never quite fit into the social norms expected of a female pop star, I’m loud and opinionated and I don’t go quietly. These are the main reasons I think using Kickstarter to fund my next record is the right move for me. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-id="16089387">

            <p>Being an independent artist has been so educational for me. It’s been liberating and challenging. It’s brought me closer to my fans (and at times to tears!). It’s helped build real, tangible, community and given me the freedom to express myself, be opinionated and make the music I want to make.</p><p>My music and live show has transformed into something I am SO proud of. After my recent sold out UK tour, I was completely blown away by the connection and excitement I was able to share with those of you in the crowd. The shows were electric. They were explosive! There was real emotional connection. Something has totally hatched between us and I want to take that further. I want to push onwards and upwards!</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-id="16111077">

            <p>There’ve been times I have wondered if I should be moulding myself to fit more neatly into boxes so that someone in a suit will want to give me money. And those times SUCK and make me sad and confused about the meaning of life and myself. So like, fuck that! Physically seeing your reactions to my new music on tour and coming up to the 10 year anniversary of my first record has made me SO reflective. It’s clear to me that I need to push forward independently. I wanna do this with YOU!</p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-id="16123866">

            <p>I have been able to grow with you. So it just makes sense to me that you guys become my record label. I trust you the most! You show up for me. I can be my honest self with you.</p><p>Playing live music and recording my feelings is the greatest gift to me in the world, and the idea of putting out a record with you guys really excites me!! So like, let’s get on with it and do it ourselves! DIY TILL WE DIE AM I RIGHT???!</p><p>I guess the next step is for me to stop being so British about it and ask for your help! Let’s get to the point. I simply cannot do this without you! I’m asking you to fund my record. Pre order the album, buy any of the rewards you want, there’s cool stuff like signed vinyl and squad jackets. </p><p><b>TSHIRT:</b></p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-id="16407307">

            <p>Basically by doing all the things you would already be doing will mean the record gets finished and released. </p><p>Ya get me? You buy it; I get to finish making it, and release it. That’s how it works. Simple. You will get to hear everything first; updates, behind-the-scenes, previews, info, artwork, etc., You will even get to download the record before anyone else! You will get a priority pass and be upgraded to Kate Nash bizniz class. </p><p>It’s like instead of me going into a boring room with record label people and sharing stuff w them and hearing feedback like “we don’t get u” or “is this what kate nash looks like now???” and “oh honey no”…I will be sending it straight to your inbox through the magical vagina of the internet and you will be like “OMYMUTHAAAFUCKKKKIN ANGELS FROM HEAVEN ABOVE CHOCOLATE CAKE SLICES AND MONKEY DANCES YASSSSSS KWEEEN SLAYYYYYY RUN A MARATHON BITCH”. Which is just how I prefer to run a business. </p><div class="template asset" contenteditable="false" data-id="16088305">
